# IPportScannerUsingShellScript
This shell script (.sh) will read source IPs, remote server IPs, and port range from a file named "IPports.txt" and print the result.
Make sure the files "IPportScanner.sh" and "IPports.txt" are in the same directory. If not you need to specific the path of "IPports.txt" in the script.
Change the permission of "IPportScanner.sh" to executable (chmod +x "IPportScanner.sh") before running the script.
